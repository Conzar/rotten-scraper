# Introduction
A program that scrapes user reviews from Rotten Tomates and produces REAL scores.

# Preface
I know this can all be done with gradle but I can't be bothered.  If you want gradle, submit a PR and I will gladly accept.

# Setup
Download the following jar files

* [jsoup](https://jsoup.org/download)
* [commons-io](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/download_io.cgi)

# Compile
Use the ./compile.bash script.

# Run
If you haven't downloaded the pages from rotten tomatores, you need to do that.  I have added a 5 second delay between requests as to not trigger DOS or anything.  I still recommend using a VPN when doing this just to be on the safe side.
